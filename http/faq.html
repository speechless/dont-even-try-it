	<h3>How do I connect to the server?</h3>
	<p>There is a 2 stage authentication scheme in place. In order to get through it,
	you must login via this website, then use your minecraft client to connect to the server.
	Please note that your website username and minecraft username should be identical.</p>
		
	<h3>Why do I need to log in through this website first?</h3>
	<p>This website is part of a security system that prevents spoof attacks.
	This means no one will be able to log into your charactor on this minecraft server.</p>
	
	<h3>My IP constantly changes, should I be worried?</h3>
	<p>No. Your IP address is temporarily stored for as part of the authentication process, but nothing is permanent.
	Issues will only arise when you try to connect to the minecraft server using a different IP address to the
	one you logged into this site with. (This normally happens when login in via http proxy)</p>
